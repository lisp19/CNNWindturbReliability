# Background Overview

This project is a course project focusing on reliability prediction of wind turb blades, based on the real world data provided by course instructors. 

The state of wind turb blades is binary, which is 0 for good and 1 for bad. The train_labels file gives the known labels of given files, and the records in historical data files consists of dozens of variables.

The purpose of the project is to construct a deep learning model to predict the status of NO.12 wind turb, based on the known data of other wind turbs. Only 30% of data of NO.12 wind turb is given.

# Project Overview

Since the data scale of NO.12 wind turb is not enough compared with the target files need to be predicted, model based transfer learning is needed to realize the project. The outline of project will be:

+ Data preprocessing
+ Construct a model with data from other wind turbs, such as NO.11, NO.95
+ Model training and tuning
+ Transfer the model to NO.12 wind turb
+ Model training and tuning
+ Evaluate the model

The prediction accuracy is ***93%***. For some reason, the original true labels can not be given here. However, the accuracy is validated by course instructors before.
